    "summary": "I am a graduate researcher with Kwan-Liu Ma at the Visualization and Interface Design Innovation(VIDI) lab at the University of California, Davis. My research focuses on visualizations, techniques, and systems for a range of datasets, including static and dynamic networks, radio signals, and fire data. I am currently leading and co-leading several teams in systems designed around exploring social networks and California wildfire datasets.\n\nMy enjoyment of learning and conducting research extends beyond my graduate career. I combine my love of research and 5+ years of FDM printing to develop new flinging foam methods. I 3D design and engineer products from concept to full production.  I also utilize my visualization skills to create interfaces that allow customers to customize and view their purchases live on the web. ",
