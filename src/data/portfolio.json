    "summary": "I am a graduate researcher with Kwan-Liu Ma at the Visualization and Interface Design Innovation(VIDI) lab at the University of California, Davis. My research focuses on visualizations, techniques, and systems for a range of datasets, including static and dynamic networks, radio signals, and fire data. I am currently leading and co-leading several teams in systems designed around exploring social networks and California wildfire datasets.\n\nMy enjoyment of learning and conducting research extends beyond my graduate career. I combine my love of research and 5+ years of FDM printing to develop new flinging foam methods. I 3D design and engineer products from concept to full production.  I also utilize my visualization skills to create interfaces that allow customers to customize and view their purchases live on the web. ",

Though most sites offer the ability to customize the user's purchase selection, they do not provide means for the user to visually see their choice immediately. It is unreasonable to photograph every possible permutation with potentially so many combinations and color choices.  There are so many possible parts and color choices that are unreasonable for every permutation to be photographed. The lack of immediate feedback can leave the user unsure how particular color and parts combinations will look.

The left visualization provides basic capabilities such as zoom and pan and updates instantly based on the user selection from the menu on the right. The user selects a color by either through section menu or individual customizing each component in the section. The dropdown menu separates color based on the cost tier. As visualization on the right cannot capture the exact color, or any nuance the filament might have such as glitter, mousing over each color provides a color correct swatch. When choosing a more expensive filament, the price changes and text updates to indicate the price difference in that section."},

Once the staff is satisfied with their choice, they can use the \"setprice\" button to create variants needed for Shopify. Variants are what Shopify uses to set prices on a combination of options. Shopify only allows 99 variants and three options. This small selection is quite limiting for 3D printed objects with 20 color choices and multiple options.
